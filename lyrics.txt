Song Lyrics: 

In my head I know your side but I'm lost in dead divide
I'll bear your stares for one last taste I could've been with you
In my heart I hide in gray, I mistimed, I lost today
I feel undressed on this occasion where we're breaking everything
There's no single burn that can drag me back in
It's time for me to dream again, I'll try to find you a postcard in June
In my eyes this round is yours, I know you know
Stuck like glue, I thought you said you were warming up to ideas of me
Now I burn and you burn, postmarked for another turn
The lights are on but I can't believe you said those things to me
